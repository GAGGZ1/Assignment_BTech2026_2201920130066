### Problem: 2369. Check if There is a Valid Partition For The Array

**Difficulty:** Medium  
**Topics:** Dynamic Programming, Recursion

### Problem Description:
You are given a 0-indexed integer array `nums`. Your task is to partition the array into one or more contiguous subarrays. A partition is valid if each subarray satisfies one of the following conditions:
1. The subarray consists of exactly 2 equal elements.  
   Example: `[2, 2]` is valid.
2. The subarray consists of exactly 3 equal elements.  
   Example: `[4, 4, 4]` is valid.
3. The subarray consists of exactly 3 consecutive increasing elements, where the difference between adjacent elements is 1.  
   Example: `[3, 4, 5]` is valid, but `[1, 3, 5]` is not.

You need to determine whether it's possible to partition the array such that at least one valid partition exists.

### Solution Approach:

1. **Recursive Approach with Memoization**:
   - We use a helper function `solve(int[] nums, int i, Boolean[] dp)` to recursively check for valid partitions starting from index `i`.
   - A `dp` array is used for memoization to store the results of subproblems and avoid redundant calculations.
   - If we have reached the end of the array (`i == nums.length`), we return `true`, indicating a valid partitioning.
   - If the result for index `i` is already calculated (i.e., `dp[i]` is not `null`), we return the stored result.

2. **Partition Conditions**:
   - **Condition 1**: If `nums[i] == nums[i+1]`, a valid partition can be formed with a 2-element subarray.
   - **Condition 2**: If `nums[i] == nums[i+1] == nums[i+2]`, a valid partition can be formed with a 3-element subarray.
   - **Condition 3**: If `nums[i] + 1 == nums[i+1]` and `nums[i] + 2 == nums[i+2]`, a valid partition can be formed with 3 consecutive increasing elements.
   
3. **Memoization**:
   - For each valid partition condition, we recursively call the `solve` function and move the index `i` forward by the appropriate number of elements.
   - If at least one of the conditions results in a valid partition, we return `true` for that subarray; otherwise, `false`.

4. **Time Complexity**:
   - The time complexity of this approach is `O(n)` where `n` is the length of the input array, as each index is processed at most once due to memoization.

### Code:

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean validPartition(int[] nums) {
        return solve(nums, 0, new Boolean[nums.length]);
    }

    public boolean solve(int[] nums, int i, Boolean[] dp) {
        if (i == nums.length)
            return true;

        if (dp[i] != null)
            return dp[i];

        boolean result = false;

        // Check if the next two elements are the same
        if ((i + 1) < nums.length && (nums[i] == nums[i + 1]))
            result = result || solve(nums, i + 2, dp);

        // Check if the next three elements are the same
        if ((i + 2) < nums.length && nums[i] == nums[i + 1] && nums[i + 1] == nums[i + 2])
            result = result || solve(nums, i + 3, dp);

        // Check if the next three elements form a consecutive sequence
        if ((i + 2) < nums.length && ((nums[i] + 1) == nums[i + 1]) && ((nums[i] + 2) == nums[i + 2]))
            result = result || solve(nums, i + 3, dp);

        return dp[i] = result;
    }
}
```

### Example:

```java
Solution solution = new Solution();
int[] nums = {1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6};  // Valid partition
boolean result = solution.validPartition(nums);
System.out.println(result);  // Output: true
```
