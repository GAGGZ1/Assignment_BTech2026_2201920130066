# Solutions to Coding Problems

This repository contains solutions for three problems, each solved with Java. Below are the problems and their respective approaches and solutions:

## Problem 1: **[2369. Check if There is a Valid Partition For The Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/check-if-there-is-a-valid-partition-for-the-array/)**

### Problem Statement:
Given a 0-indexed integer array `nums`, partition the array into one or more contiguous subarrays. A partition is valid if each of the obtained subarrays satisfies one of the following conditions:
- The subarray consists of exactly two equal elements (e.g., [2, 2]).
- The subarray consists of exactly three equal elements (e.g., [4, 4, 4]).
- The subarray consists of exactly three consecutive increasing elements, where the difference between adjacent elements is 1 (e.g., [3, 4, 5]).

Return `true` if the array has at least one valid partition, otherwise return `false`.

### Approach:
We use dynamic programming (DP) to solve this problem. We maintain a DP array `dp[i]` to check if the subarray from index `0` to `i` can be partitioned validly.

### Solution:
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean validPartition(int[] nums) {
        return solve(nums, 0, new Boolean[nums.length]);
    }

    public boolean solve(int[] nums, int i, Boolean[] dp) {
        if (i == nums.length)
            return true;

        if (dp[i] != null)
            return dp[i];

        boolean result = false;

        // Check if the next two elements are the same
        if ((i + 1) < nums.length && (nums[i] == nums[i + 1]))
            result = result || solve(nums, i + 2, dp);

        // Check if the next three elements are the same
        if ((i + 2) < nums.length && nums[i] == nums[i + 1] && nums[i + 1] == nums[i + 2])
            result = result || solve(nums, i + 3, dp);

        // Check if the next three elements form a consecutive sequence
        if ((i + 2) < nums.length && ((nums[i] + 1) == nums[i + 1]) && ((nums[i] + 2) == nums[i + 2]))
            result = result || solve(nums, i + 3, dp);

        return dp[i] = result;
    }
}
```

## Problem 2: **[1582. Special Positions in a Binary Matrix](https://leetcode.com/problems/special-positions-in-a-binary-matrix/)**

### Problem Statement:
You are given a `m x n` binary matrix `mat`. A position in the matrix is "special" if itâ€™s the only `1` in its row and the only `1` in its column. Return the number of special positions in the matrix.

### Approach:
- Count the number of `1`s in each row and column.
- Check for each `1` in the matrix if it is the only `1` in its row and column.

### Solution:
```java
class Solution {
  public int numSpecial(int[][] mat) {
      int m = mat.length;
      int n = mat[0].length;
      int[] rowCount = new int[m];
      int[] colCount = new int[n];
      
      for (int row = 0; row < m; row++) {
          for (int col = 0; col < n; col++) {
              if (mat[row][col] == 1) {
                  rowCount[row]++;
                  colCount[col]++;
              }
          }
      }
      
      int result = 0;
      for (int row = 0; row < m; row++) {
          for (int col = 0; col < n; col++) {
              if (mat[row][col] == 1) {
                  if (rowCount[row] == 1 && colCount[col] == 1) {
                      result++;
                  }
              }
          }
      }
      
      return result;
  }
}
```

## Problem 3: **[867. Transpose Matrix](https://leetcode.com/problems/transpose-matrix/)**

### Problem Statement:
Given a 2D matrix `matrix`, return the transpose of `matrix`. The transpose of a matrix is obtained by swapping the rows and columns.

### Approach:
- Create a new matrix with swapped dimensions (rows become columns and columns become rows).
- Loop through each element and assign it to the transposed position.

### Solution:
```java
class Solution {
  public int[][] transpose(int[][] matrix) {
      int rows = matrix.length;
      int cols = matrix[0].length;
      int[][] transposed = new int[cols][rows]; // Swapping dimensions

      for (int i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
          for (int j = 0; j < cols; j++) {
              transposed[j][i] = matrix[i][j]; // Swapping indices
          }
      }
      return transposed;
  }
}
```
