## **Overview**
This repository contains daily solutions for the assignments as per the guidelines provided for the **B. Tech 2026 Passing Out Batch**. The solutions are categorized into three domains: **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)**, **Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS)**, and **Database Management Systems (DBMS)**. The solutions showcase core programming concepts such as efficient algorithm design, database queries and normalization, and Object-Oriented principles like inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation, and abstraction.

Each day, the following problems are solved and updated in this repository:
- **Three (3) problems** related to **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** from platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, Codeforces, etc.
- **One (1) problem** related to **Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS)**.
- **One (1) problem** related to **Database Management Systems (DBMS)** from any coding platform.
